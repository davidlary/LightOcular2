abstract="Pupillometry research has experienced an enormous revival in the last two decades. Here we briefly review the surge of recent studies on task-evoked pupil dilation in the context of cognitive control tasks with the primary aim being to evaluate the feasibility of using pupil dilation as an index of effort exertion, rather than task demand or difficulty. Our review shows that across the three cognitive control domains of updating, switching, and inhibition, increases in task demands typically leads to increases in pupil dilation. Studies show a diverging pattern with respect to the relationship between pupil dilation and performance and we show how an effort account of pupil dilation can provide an explanation of these findings. We also discuss future directions to further corroborate this account in the context of recent theories on cognitive control and effort and their potential neurobiological substrates.",

Results are presented showing the influence of adaptation and of form and size of test-object upon contrast sensitivity.The results of the investigation show that the least perceptible brightness-difference between an object and its background increases directly with the illumination at the eye from the dazzle-source; varies approximately inversely with the square of the angle which the glare-source makes with the line of vision; and is practically independent of the brightness, size, type, distance, etc. of the dazzle-source.Considerable study has been given to the variations of the pupil under steady, fluctuating, and glaring lights and of their influence upon vision. Results of the investigations upon irradiation, after-images, blinding-glare and light-shocks are also presented.},

This is the best estimate that can be made to date of the pupil size---luminance relationship. To make the data of more general use they were corrected for the Stiles-Crawford effect and expressed so that retinal illuminance, adjusted for average pupil size, may be obtained directly from knowledge of the luminance of the stimulus field. The expression for this is logE(trolands)$=$logB$+$1.8614--0.000986 (logB$+$6.5)3, where E is the retinal illuminance in trolands and B is luminance in millilamberts. It is unfortunate that no extensive measurements have been made in this important area.},

This research note explores the possibility that this is due, in part, to differences in the size of the adapting fields used by various workers. We present measurements of pupil diameter as a function of luminance for a variety of field subtenses. The results indicate a consistent trend for smaller subtenses to produce less pupil constriction. For field diameters of up to 25°, replotting the data in terms of corneal flux density (i.e. the product of luminance and subtended area) causes an approximate convergence onto a single function described by D = 7.75−5.75 [(F/846)0.41/((F/846)0.41 + 2)] where D is the pupil diameter (mm) and F is the corneal flux density (cdm−2deg2). This equation should be of some practical use in estimation of natural pupil diameter."

abstract = "Ocular dominance is the tendency to prefer visual input from one eye to the other [e.g. Porac, C. & Coren, S. (1976). The dominant eye. Psychological Bulletin 83(5), 880–897]. In standard sighting tests, most people consistently fall into either the left- or right eye-dominant category [Miles, W. R. (1930). Ocular dominance in human adults. Journal of General Psychology 3, 412–420]. Here we show this static concept to be flawed, being based on the limited results of sighting with gaze pointed straight ahead. In a reach–grasp task for targets within the binocular visual field, subjects switched between left and right eye dominance depending on horizontal gaze angle. On average, ocular dominance switched at gaze angles of only 15.5° off center."
